    <string name="FAQ"><b><u>Does My Car have OBD-II?</u></b> \n\nAll 1996 and newer vehicles, both petrol and diesel fuel passenger vehicles. The vehicles are required to have OBD-II systems. To verify that your
        vehicle is equipped with OBD II, you can look for the words "OBD II" on the emission control information label attached to the underside of the vehicle hood</string>

    <string name="FAQ1"><b><u>What is the Engine RPM sensor?</u></b> \n\nRPM means "Revolutions Per Minute". It measures the number of times the Crankshaft rotates in the engine. when combustion
    (aka The vehicle is started) in the engine cylinder occurs, the pistons begin moving up and down. The motion this creates is sent to the Crankshaft and this motion is what is
        measured as RPM</string>

    <string name="FAQ2"><b><u>What is the Engine Load sensor? </u></b> \n\n The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor. Engine load is the amount of vacuum in the intake
    manifold. The reading drops when the throttle is open (when vehicle is accelerating)</string>

    <string name="FAQ3"><b><u>What is the Coolant Temperature sensor?</u></b> \n\nA CTS is used to measure the temperature of the coolant in the cooling system of a vehicle. This sensor gives off a reading indicating how
    much heat the engine is giving off. The ECU uses this sensor to keep the engine temperature down by adjusting the fuel injection, fuel mix and when the electric fan is switched on and off.</string>

    <string name="FAQ4"><b><u>What is the Mass Airflow Rate sensor?</u></b> \n\nThis sensor is used to find out the mass flow rate of air that is entering an engine. This sensor is required to help balance and deliver
    the correct fuel mass to the engine, due to the fact that air changes its density with temperature and pressure.</string>

    <string name="FAQ5"><b><u>What is the Throttle Position sensor? </u></b>\n\nThis sensor is used to monitor the throttle position of a vehicle. </string>

    <string name="FAQ6"><b><u>What is the Engine Air Temperature sensor?</u></b> \n\nThis sensor monitors the temperature of the air entering the engine.</string>
